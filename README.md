# Prediction of cancellations in tourist accommodations :bar_chart:
## Description: 
+ This project have analyzed a Kaggle dataset about the cancellations in tourist accommodations
+ Also we use ML models to generate a model that have predict cancellations
+ Link to dataset: [**Kaggle** :open_file_folder:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)
## Technologies
+ Python <img src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/python-5.svg" alt="pythonicon" width="20"/> 
+ Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn :books:
## Modelos ML
+ Decision Tree: In this case was so usefull, have a so good grade of metrics with reference to confusion matrix
+ XGboost: That was the more heavier model, but same as Decision Tree, have a so good grade of metrics with reference to confusion matrix
- Note: The result of the confusion matrix may be like this because it is a synthetic data
## Challenges
+ It is not always necessary to use the best model of the most weighted model to make a good prediction model.
+ Boxplots never have to be perfect or symmetrical
## Vision to Future
+ Create Seaborn charts <img src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/seaborn-1.svg" alt="seabornicon" width="20"/>
+ Allow exporting the result to Excel <img src="https://img.icons8.com/?size=512&id=117561&format=png" alt="excelicon" width="20"/>
+ Demonstrate more completeness of the model <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/9004/9004795.png" alt="neuronalred" width="20"/>
